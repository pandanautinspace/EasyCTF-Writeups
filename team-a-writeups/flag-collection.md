# Flag Collection

Here's a [collection of flags](https://github.com/EasyCTF/easyctf-2017-problems/blob/master/flag-collection/$%7Bflags_zip%7D)! I think you're looking for a specific one, though...

## Hint:

Looking through all these files must be a pain...

## Solution:

The flags.zip contains a thumbs.db database, which normally contains thumbnails for all images in a folder. This one contained one extra image: a qr code.

## Flag:

thumbs.db\_c4n\_b3\_useful
